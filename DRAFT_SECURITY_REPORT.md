### 1. Logging of Sensitive Information

**Vulnerability:** Logging of Sensitive Information
**Severity:** Low
**Location:** `scripts/backup.ps1`
**Line Content:** `Write-Log $backupOutput`
**Description:** The script logs the entire output of the `php artisan backup:run` command. If an error occurs during the backup process, the error message might contain sensitive information, such as database credentials or file paths. This information is then written to the log file.
**Recommendation:** Instead of logging the entire output, check the exit code of the `php artisan backup:run` command. If the command fails, log a generic error message. If more detailed information is needed for debugging, consider writing it to a separate, more restricted log file.
